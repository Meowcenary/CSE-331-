I put a lot of extra functions that are never used into my program just because I noticed them in the book as I was reading through. I dont think
this will be a problem but if it please let me know for future reference.

Command to compile program: make -f bst.makefile
Command to run program: ./BST [input file if in same directory as compiled program or full path from root to input file]
